👋 Hello, I’m Pooja.

I recently graduated in Computer Science from Northern Illinois University. Worked as a Research Assistant in NIU.

I get excited about the opportunities where I get to engineer technologies that aid people in pursuing productive, distraction-free, and a meaningful life

My areas of greatest strength are in Java, C, Python, C++, Spring Boot and web development - HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript. I'm an aspiring programmer who is always looking to learn and enhance my skillset.

Currently I'm learning React
